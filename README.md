### Technologies

Built using React, JavaScript and CSS. All stats are fetched from [PotterAPI](https://potterapi.com/). Navigation handled by React Router.

### Getting Started

[Harry Potter Home](https://jnlsings.github.io/Harry-Potter-App/)

The homepage displays the various Hogwarts houses which, when clicked will take the user to that houseâ€™s stats. On each house's page, the user can click on a member to see that character's stats. Alternatively, one can access the full list of characters and their stats by clicking the "Characters" link in the header.
